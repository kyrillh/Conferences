  abstract = {In the recently developed Krylov deferred correction (KDC) methods for differential algebraic equation initial value problems (Huang, Jia, Minion, 2007), a Picard-type collocation formulation is preconditioned using low-order time integration schemes based on spectral deferred correction (SDC), and the resulting system is solved efficiently using Newton-Krylov methods. KDC methods have the advantage that methods with arbitrarily high order of accuracy can be easily constructed which have similar computational complexity as lower order methods. In this paper, we investigate semi-implicit KDC (SI-KDC) methods in which the stiff component of the preconditioner is treated implicitly and the non-stiff parts explicitly. For certain types of problems, such a semi-implicit treatment can significantly reduce the computational cost of the preconditioner compared to fully implicit KDC (FI-KDC) methods. Preliminary analysis and numerical experiments show that the convergence of Newton-Krylov iterations in the SI-KDC methods is similar to that in FI-KDC, and hence the SI-KDC methods offer a reduction in overall computational cost for such problems.},

  abstract = {[In the solution by numerical methods of ordinary and partial differential equations, the derivatives are replaced by their finite-difference equivalents, usually infinite series of differences. For the employment of relaxation methods it has been customary to ignore all but the dominant first term of these series, taking sufficient intervals to ensure the effective vanishing of the neglected terms. In this paper, methods are developed whereby the full difference equations can be used at the maximum interval consistent with the convergence of the differences. The number of mesh points, and hence the labour and difficulty of the relaxation process, is thus considerably reduced, and increased accuracy is obtained. The method is applied to eight examples, including ordinary and partial differential equations, eigen-value problems, and the more difficult problem of curved boundaries.]}

  abstract = {The choice of a numerical method for the solution of ordinary differential equations depends on the associated boundary conditions. When all the boundary conditions are specified at one end of the range of integration, one of the well-known step-by-step methods will generally be used, while the method of relaxation is reserved for the case in which boundary conditions are specified at more than one point (               1               ). In the latter, simple but inaccurate finite-difference formulae are used to provide a first approximation to the required solution; this approximation is then used to give an estimate of the errors involved in the use of the inaccurate formulae, and successive corrections are obtained until the full, accurate finite-difference equations are satisfied (               1               ). The same principle is followed in this paper with regard to step-by-step methods, the main difference being the way in which approximate solutions are obtained. In relaxation methods simultaneous equations are solved, while in the use of the step-by-step methods suggested here successive pivotal values are built up by the use of recurrence relations. All the methods of this paper follow this principle, differing only in the method of obtaining a recurrence relation, and consequently in the form of the correction terms.},

  abstract = {In this article, we present the Python framework pySDC for solving collocation problems with spectral deferred correction (SDC) methods and their time-parallel variant PFASST, the parallel full approximation scheme in space and time. pySDC features many implementations of SDC and PFASST, from simple implicit timestepping to high-order implicit-explicit or multi-implicit splitting and multilevel SDCs. The software package comes with many different, preimplemented examples and has seven tutorials to help new users with their first steps. Time parallelism is implemented either in an emulated way for debugging and prototyping or using MPI for benchmarking. The code is fully documented and tested using continuous integration, including most results of previous publications. Here, we describe the structure of the code by taking two different perspectives: those of the user and those of the developer. The first sheds light on the front-end, the examples, and the tutorials, and the second is used to describe the underlying implementation and the data structures. We show three different examples to highlight various aspects of the implementation, the capabilities, and the usage of pySDC. In addition, couplings to the FEniCS framework and PETSc, the latter including spatial parallelism with MPI, are described.},

Since its initial release in 2001, SciPy has become a de facto standard for leveraging scientific algorithms in Python, with over 600 unique code contributors, thousands of dependent packages, over 100,000 dependent repositories and millions of downloads per year. In this work, we provide an overview of the capabilities and development practices of SciPy 1.0 and highlight some recent technical developments.},
